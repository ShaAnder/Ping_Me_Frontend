TESTING.md

Testing file for the ping me PP5 frontend app, this testing file is split into three major parts, testing validation and bugs

## Testing

The app underwent comprehensive testing during development to ensure each feature worked according to specifcations perfectly
For frontend development I also ran diagnostic and dummy packet tests through postman to ensure that it connected and recived the data

The app was also tested on a variety of devices and sizes and found to be working perfectly, a few minor responsive issues aside

Below you can find an exhaustive list of tests done on the app to ensure its standards were up to the test

As well as this I also tested the app with friends and family to ensure full compatibility on a wide array of devices, the app works on mulitple browsers, devices, and also features several accessibility options to enhance the user experience

## Validation;

### Linting:

As this app was built primarily using typescript, linting is not much of an issue, the app is designed to be secure robust and error free as typescript does not allow the app to run with linting errors. There was one error i ran into during dev though in the form of "unexpected" anys, these are due to a newer version of react typescript being used on older mui components, and are primarily false flags. To fix them I was prevented with two options.

1. to use the eslint disabler at the top of files with this unexpected any (which i ultimately chose to do)
2. use the newer unknown prop, which would not have worked with the application

### CSS validation

As this app was built using mui material no css files were used, and as such we cannot use a validator

### JS validation

As this app was built in typescript validation proved difficult, as typescript props are typically seen as unexpected identifiers

[alt text](err/unexpected.jpg)

however basic react validation showed no errors or syntax issues, or at least the non typescript files i tested

### BUGS

The application has no major bugs to speak of bar one, that is rare and hard for me to replicate, sometimes very rarely there is apparently a situation where the categories / server data does not load before the page does causing a no servers found or a no categories found message. This has been extremely hard to replicate and I have only managed it once, through spam reloading the application

The person who intitially found it has not found it again since reporting it so it's on the list of future fixes
